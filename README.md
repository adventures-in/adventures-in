## Share your Project

Entirely optional but if you have a public project that's open to taking contributions and you may like to:

  1. post in Discord with the project name and repo address
  2. we'll create a category for the project with channels 'chat' and 'updates' and give you a webhook that you can setup to post updates (eg. [for github](https://gist.github.com/jagrosh/5b1761213e33fc5b54ec7f6379034a22))
- add it to the Adventures-In GitHub org
